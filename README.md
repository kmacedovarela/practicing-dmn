# Practicing DMN with Kogito

This project includes dmn decisions and its respective unit tests. 

## Running the tests
To run the test scenarios:
```shell script
./mvnw clean test
```

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw clean package
```
It produces the `practicing-dmn-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in the `/target` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

Run the application with:
```shell script
java -jar target/practicing-dmn-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
```

And check the automatically generated endpoints generated by Kogito for the decisions:
